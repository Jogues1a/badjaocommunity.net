<center>In this experiment, we will be conducting a research to see how composting <br>
<br>
can help in plant growth, how it is beneficial to the Badjao community, and the environment. <br>
<br>
Our main focus is to determine how composting helps in the growth of our Alugbati plant, <br>
<br>
scientifically known as, Basella Alba. By conducting this study, we can appropriately analyze <br>
<br>
the data, locate further evidence, observe changes in the growth of our plant, and how we <br>
<br>
can take advantage of its benefits. The purpose of this study is for us to be able to share<br>
<br>
 new knowledge to other people, especially our partner institution which we believe can highly <br>
 <br>
 benefit from this study because they lack food and are prone to certain illnesses. Through this <br>
 <br>
 study they can attain their need of food by planting vegetables and fruits with the use of compost.<br>

<div class="myDiv3">
<center>Composting is a process of recycling organic matter such as fruit peels, vegetable peels, <br>
<br>
eggshells, or any other food scraps and turning them into a fertilizer that will help enrich the <br>
<br>
soil to help our plant grow. Composting helps in gardening because it reduces the need for chemical<br>
<br>
 fertilizers which can lead to serious issues that will affect the growth of our plants. Composting <br>
 <br>
 allows our plants to develop healthier roots into the soil, makes any soil easier to work with, helps <br>
 <br>
 alter the soils structure making it unlikely to erode or spatter, compost can also hold nutrients tight <br>
 <br>
 enough for it not to wash out but loosely enough to allow the plants to take up the nutrients that it needs, <br>
 <br>
 and many other benefits. We can use vegetable or fruit peels as our compost, in this experiment, we made use <br>
 <br>
 of onion peels as it contains a good amount of nutrients such as, nitrogen, potassium, calcium, iron, magnesium, <br>
 <br>
 phosphorus, and more which are all essential to the healthy growth of plants. Through the benefits that composting<br>
<br>
 brings in plant growth, our Alugbati plant can make use of these making it grow faster and healthier as it was able<br>
<br>
 to get all the vitamins and nutrients that it needs to become a healthy plant. Composting is beneficial to our <br>
 <br>
 environment as well because it helps reduce the greenhouse emissions at landfills, creates a sustainable agricultural <br>
 <br>
 system, promotes the uptake of carbon dioxide through vegetation, makes our environment more resilient to the effects <br>
 <br>
 of climate change, and more. Our partner institution, the Badjao community, can make use of the benefits from composting<br>
<br>
 through planting. They can plant fruits or vegetables like the Alugbati plant for example since it is a great source of <br>
 <br>
 nutrients and through composting they will be able to grow a healthy plant. Since the Badjao community are struggling <br>
 <br>
 to find food, planting would be of great help to them since it is a fast and easy way of getting access to healthy food <br>
 <br>
 with the help of composting. Not only will they be able to eat well but they will also gain lots of nutrients and <br>
 <br>
 vitamins such as, magnesium, zinc, iron, calcium, phosphorus, fiber, etc. which are present in vegetables and fruits, <br>
 <br>
 they can also get some exercise through this planting activity which will help them attain a healthier and stronger <br>
 <br>
 immune system. Lastly, the Badjao community will also be able to contribute in the process of attaining a healthier and <br>
 <br>
 better environment, given that composting has a lot of benefits to the environment.</div><br>

<br>
<font face= "Dishonorable Mention: Comic Sans"size=4 font color="Indigo">
<div class="myDiv1">
<center><div>In general, compost is decayed organic matter used as fertilizer. 

One of the things that compost fertilizer does to plants to help 

them grow is that compost loosens the soil so that the roots can 

absorb nutrients. Compost also increases the soil's capacity to 

hold nutrients while supplying the soil with essential nutrients. 

In our project, we chose banana peels as our compost material as

 it is very easy to compost and requires less attention than when

 composting food scraps. Fruit waste, such as bananas and their 

 peels, average 35 parts carbon to 1 part nitrogen, so they are

 quite close to the recommended ratio on their own. You only
 
 need to add a few grass clippings, which average 20 to 1, and
 
 you will have created a nice balance. Banana peels in compost 
 
 adds healthy organic material, which helps the compost retain 
 
 water and make the soil lighter when added to your garden. 
 
 In addition to this, banana peels will break down quickly in 
 
 compost, which allows them to add these important nutrients
 
 to the compost much more quickly than some other compost
 
 materials.</div></center>
