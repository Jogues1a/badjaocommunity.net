<br>
<div>The presenting issue/challenges that the partner institution is facing was the lack of food in <br>
<br>
the Badjao community. The Badjao community is lack of everything specially the foods, and it <br>
<br>
can cause a malnutrition and death of the children. Lack of healthy sustenance in the Philippines <br>
<br>
<img src="picture 8.jpg" width="300" height="200"align="right">
 half the populace experience hunger related conditions. In the Philippines, around 50% of populace <br>
<br>
experience weakness brought by lack of iron. Enormous rates of individuals experience the ill <br>
<br>
effects of other unhealthiness related infirmities.</div><br><br><br><div>Such infirmities lead exhaustion and diminished <br>
<br>
invulnerable capability.  An individual influenced by hunger isn’t getting an adequate number of supplements, <br>
<br>
either because of an absence of food of a less than stellar eating routine. In kids, this can prompt hindered <br>
<br>
development. Besides, it can prompt serious medical problems for individuals, all things considered. <br>
<br>
These medical problems can be persistent, and make it difficult for people to have a supported work. <br>
<br>
Furthermore, these issues can leave kids stranded quite early in life, sustaining the pattern of neediness.</div><br>

 
 <br><br><br>
 <div>The evidence that supports our answer in the previous question is that we have asked some of the members <br>
 <br>
 <img src="picture 9.jpg" width="300" height="200"align="right">of the Bajao Community through online conference questions about what the food situation is like in <br>
 <br>
 their community. From what they have said, the food situation there is that they are low on food, <br>
 <br>
 that many of the children are malnourished, while their parents are out working to make enough money <br>
 <br>
 to feed the children and the community. Which is why  we need to act on this and provide any help we can.</div><br>
<br>
  <p style="text-align:right;">
  <br><br><br>

 <div>The issue or challenge of our partner institutions' basic needs, particularly their desire for food to survive. <br>
 <br>
 They struggle greatly because there is not enough food for them. If we can help them, we should, <br>
 <br>
 perhaps by giving a donation. I said this because the institution's help to the Badjao community must ensure <br>
 <br>
 that it has access to enough food in order to raise the community's standard of living. The Badjao Community <br>
 <br>
 really does need help because food is so important to our health. They must consume enough food to sustain a<br>
<br>
 healthy lifestyle, which is why I brought it up. They are having difficulty since they do not have enough food.</div><br>
<br>

 <br><br><br>
 <div>Above all, finding a solution to this problem will benefit them and enhance their health. On the other hand,<br> 
 <br>
 <img src="picture 11.jpg" width="300" height="200"align="left">they also have a program that will benefit their community. This is everything that demonstrates how pertinent<br>
<br>
 their problem or problems are to our partner organization, the Badjao Community.<br>
<br>
 <p style="text-align:left;">
 The partner institution responds to this issue by implementing programs.  <br>
 <br>
 The partner institution has implemented family and health planning which is a <br>
 <br>
 program that supplies the community with basic necessities like food, water, shelter, clothes etc. <br>
 <br>
 The institution also have implemented other programs like literacy programs for adults and children <br>
 <br>
 and engages in environmental restoration and prevention along the coastline. By implementing all of these programs, <br>
 <br>
 the Badjao community might have a chance on living a comfortable and healthy life.</div><br>
 </p>
 <br>
 <br>
  <br><br><br>
<div>The data can contribute to the resilience and empowerment of the partner community as it <br>
<br>
will make people more aware of their situation and provide ideas of what can be done to <br>
<br>
respond to their issues, challenges, or needs. The data seeks to inform and inspire others <br>
<br>
to help those in need from the Badjao community who are currently facing the issue of a lack of basic needs, <br>
<br>
especially food, which is one of the most essential needs of our body as it contains the nutrients and vitamins <br>
<br>
that we need in order to achieve good health.</div> 
<br>
<div>This is why it is important to be aware of issues like this <br>
<br>
because it will inspire us to provide the help that we are capable of giving to those who are in need. <br>
<br>
For example, we can donate some food, clothes, or pre-loved items that we don’t need or want anymore. <br>
<br>
We can also do simple things like, posting some information about the institution to spread awareness about <br>
<br>
their situation or advocacy. Doing simple things like this will contribute to the resilience and empowerment <br>
<br>
of the partner community.</div><br>
