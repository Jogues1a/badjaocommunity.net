The problem that our project aims to solve is the lack of food.
It is important to address and solve this problem because food 
insecurity makes people prone to illnesses and a weaker immune 
system as they are unable to take in enough nutrients and 
vitamins to support their body, they may develop certain 
health issues like high blood pressure, heart disease, 
diabetes, malnutrition etc. which can be caused by hunger, 
and children are especially vulnerable to these dire economic 
circumstances which puts them at greater risk. Finding a 
solution to this problem will not only help them attain 
their basic needs like food but they will also have a more 
reliable and stable source of income which then helps them 
earn enough money for their basic necessities and to provide
 for their families. And also our project aims to educate the 
 Badjao Community to survive in daily lives while dealing with 
 other problems. We encourage them to learn how to properly 
 grow and sustain vegetable food in times of shortage problems. 
 Keeping these things in mind will now help us come up with better 
 solutions that would help us solve the said issue more effectively
 especially at our young age, which is how we came up with the 
 idea of donating. Given that their business of selling items 
 such as, clothes, shoes, accessories, and toys is one of their 
 main sources of income, we have agreed that donating our pre-loved 
 items that are still in good condition would be the best solution
 that we could offer to them as donating our pre-loved items will 
 provide them with more things to sell for their business and will 
 help them earn more money. In addition, we will also be boosting 
 their business through social media by posting about their community, needs, 
 and business because this will help us educate people about the Badjao 
 community and encourage others to reach out, help, and support the community.
 Also encourage other people to donate vegetable seeds to help the Badjao community 
 in planting healthy foods. And it helps them to survive in case no one can’t 
 donate because other people have their own problems too like financial problems.  
 With that being said, we believe that our proposed solution will help the Badjao 
 community have a stable source of income and attain their basic necessities.

Our project is important because it can help the community live more comfortably and healthy. Our project helps them to make their immune system stronger as we will provide them knowledge on planting veggies and fruits in their community. By doing this, the project will secure food shortages from occurring. Our project will also improve the community’s sanitation to a greater extent to lessen diseases in the area. A portion of our project’s budget will be used to buy vegetable and fruit seeds to be planted in the area.

<div class="myuuDiv">
The main goal of the project is to help them attain a stable source of income and provide service on how to plant their own food, for instance on how to grow them properly. Therefore they will be able to sustain vegetable plants, having said that they will not be able to experience a short shortage again because they will be able to learn how to plant their own food. As well as our project is not only to teach them but also to help them by donating them such as pre-loved items. Apart from this, our group wants to help the badjao community  in our own way.
The specific objectives of the project include:
<br>
1. To provide donations to them such as pre-loved items<br>
<br>
2. To come up with how to maintain their coastline.<br>
<br>
3. To promote hygiene and sanitation. <br>
<br>
4. To help them boost their business.<br>

<font face= "Georgia"size=5>
<font color="red">

The shortage of basic necessities, including food, is an issue in the Badjao Community. They are unable to purchase suitable foods, such as wholesome and nutritious foods, due to their inconsistent source of income and poverty. A Badjao uses a variety of methods to support themselves in the city, including fishing and hawking second-hand clothing on the streets. Due to their severe discrimination and lack of access to wholesome, nutritional meals for their growth, children are also impacted. The Badjaos struggled as was to be expected during a period when the Coronavirus had partially compelled people to stay at home. Since the city was in lockdown, they were all having trouble finding work and making money. They have few options for surviving, and they are powerless. We, therefore, decide what the best way is to assist them in surviving. We considered donating our pre-loved items which are still in good condition and encouraging others to do the same. Giving to the organizations that represent the cause you care about benefits both the charities and you personally. Millions of people regularly donate to charities to support issues they care about and for the benefits it brings to their own lives.

<font face= "Georgia"size=5>
<font color="#4A235A">

The problem of the Badjao community is the lack of basic needs, most especially, food. Changes in the law have banned fishing in the areas where the Badjao have been fishing for centuries, because of this, they struggle to find food because this is one of their only sources of food. This also affects them financially as this is one of their sources of income, without access to fishing, they won’t have fish to sell and they continue to struggle in poverty and hunger. Because they lack food, they become prone to certain illnesses such as high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, malnutrition, etc. which can be caused by hunger, this is because they are not able to take in enough nutrients and vitamins, hence a weaker immune system, making them prone to these illnesses. We want the Badjao community to experience fair treatment without injustice, corruption, discrimination, and oppression. As much as possible, we want to help them to live a comfortable life, especially the children of the community as they are more vulnerable to these dire economic circumstances. The purpose or improvement that we wish to accomplish is to help them gain access to more food since it is one of the most essential needs of our body and it is something they struggle to find. We want to see them live a long, happy, and healthy life. On top of this, we want to give them hope that their life will eventually get better as long as we all work together and have that willingness and passion to help their community.

The problem first started in the early days of the Bajao Community starting a life in Davao City, and in where they used to live. It has existed wherever they go to to find a home as they are continuously facing discrimination, oppression, and injustice which is why they can’t live a comfortable life and are living in extreme poverty. Solving this problem is related to the business goals of our organization because our goal is to provide the Badjao community with a comfortable life, stable source of income, and to help them attain their basic necessities. Through the proposed solution that we agreed on, we will be able to meet the goals of our organization and the needs of the Badjao community.

<font face= "Georgia"size=5>
<font color="blue">
The solution we intend to propose in order to solve the problem described is donation. We will gather our pre-loved items such as, clothes, shoes, accessories, and toys that are still in good condition so that they can sell them for their business since this is one of their main sources of income. Furthermore, we can boost their business by using our social media platforms to encourage others to buy from them and donate some of their pre-loved items as well, that way, the Badjao community will have more items to sell which they can earn more money from. Our proposed solution would be effective because millions of people are using and are active on social media hence we will be able to encourage many to donate or buy from the community which will boost their business. In addition, using social media to bring awareness to the cause, context, and needs of the community will become the key to advocacy. Raising awareness will educate people about the Badjao community, will inspire/motivate others to participate in bringing change, and will also help us build a community around the issue. This is why our proposed solution would be effective and is better than alternatives because it is simple yet also one of the most effective ways of helping the Badjao community. However, in order to make this project successful, we must have the patience, time, dedication, and willingness to help our partner community because this will encourage and inspire us to keep helping our community in order to lead them to a more comfortable life.

The intervention that we intend to propose to address the problem discussed above is a donation. We will be gathering our pre-loved items such as clothes, shoes, accessories, and toys that are still in good condition so that they can sell them for their business. Selling items like these are one of their main sources of income which is why donating our pre-loved items or items that we don’t use anymore would be helpful to the Badjao community as they will have more items to sell for their business. Furthermore, we can boost their business through social media. By using our social media platforms, we can encourage people to buy from their business as it would really help them earn some money to buy some basic necessities like food. We may also encourage others to donate some of their pre-loved items as well, that way the Badjao community will have more items to sell which they can earn money from. Using social media to bring awareness to the cause, context, and needs of the Badjao community can become the key to advocacy which will also help us convince policy makers to take action to help the community and find a solution to solve the issues that they are currently facing. In addition, raising awareness educates people about the Badjao community and motivates them to participate in bringing change. Social media is a powerful platform for spreading awareness given that majority of people are active on social media so when we raise awareness using our platforms, a lot of people may be able to see it and become inspired by it. Therefore, we can build a community around the issue through social media by simply educating others and spreading awareness on the said issue. Lastly, this can also benefit us because we are able to use our social media platforms positively, responsibly, wisely, and for a good cause.

The product/service/proposal that we are offering is donating things that they're not using or they would like to give. We can donate money, clothes, and other useful things that they can have. Giving to the charities that represent the causes you care about benefits both the charities and you personally. Millions of people regularly donate to charities to support issues they care about and for the benefits it brings to their own lives.
The thing in the community profile that made us to think this proposal is that the community's need for basic needs stuck out to us. I say this because they are constantly getting descriminated which leads to not having jobs and therefore they do not have a main source of income and could not buy basic needs such as food.This is why we want to address this problem in the community, which led to us creating this proposal.
The resources that we would need to gather and raise funds for, in order to make this proposal a reality are the pre-loved items that we will be donating to the community which they can still sell for their business. We also need to use our social media platforms responsibly in order for us to effectively spread awareness and promote the Badjao community. We are donating the pre-loved items to the Badjao community for them to sell in their business as well as promoting their business through social media because we want to help them increase their income so that they can use the money to buy their basic necessities. By doing so, we are hoping to achieve our goals and turn the proposal into a reality so that the Badjao community will have a better life.

Having analyzed the consumption of our partner institution, the needs that they have <br>
<br>
that are unmet are their basic needs, most especially, food. Changes in the law have <br>
<br>
banned all fishing, in the areas where the Badjao have been fishing for centuries. <br>
<br>
It got to a point where young men have to risk their lives to fishing just so they <br>
<br>
can have something to eat. Because food is essential to our health, the Badjao <br>
<br>
Community is in great need of it. This is because food contains the vitamins and <br>
<br>
nutrients that our body needs in order to have a strong and healthy immune system. <br>
<br>
Without enough food, it increases their risk of health problems or chronic diseases. <br>
<br>
In conclusion to all of this, it is important that their needs are met because this<br>
<br>
 is a part of their rights and essential needs in order to live a good and healthy life.<br>

<b>Given our group’s capabilities, we can put these resources together by donating them <br>
<br>
to the community in order to meet these unmet needs most effectively. We can offer our <br>
<br>
help to donate goods to the community like food, water, clothes and other essential needs. <br>
<br>
By doing this, it can address the needs of our partner institution. It is because the<br>
<br>
 community lacks basic necessities, especially food. By donating goods, we can help the <br>
 <br>
 people of the community to have a healthier and comfortable life. They will also gain <br>
 <br>
 enough nutrients to stay healthy.<br></b>

 either monthly or yearly. We can also encourage other people to do the same thing and spread awareness <br>
 <br>
 on the community’s situation to inspire others to help them attain their basic needs and to gain support <br>

We should know their source of income because it can help us with our decisions. <br>
<br>
Our decisions will have an impact on an organization's financial health, and <br>
<br>
knowing how this works will enable us to contribute more successfully and make<br>
<br>
 wiser choices. Being financially literate is also highly beneficial for our <br>
 <br>
 personal life because it gives us greater self-assurance <br>
 <br>
 when making decisions. Financial wellness is crucial because it gives us<br>
 <br>
 knowledge and abilities we need to handle our finances wisely. <br>
 <br>
 Being financially responsible and independent requires having the ability <br>
 <br>
 to trace of cost, create a budgets, and stick to it.</font> <br>

 The Badjao community of the institution's help must have access<br>
 <br>
 to enough food for their community in order to improve their quality of life. <br>
 <br>
 In fact, because food is essential to our health, <br>
 <br>
 the Badjao Community is in need. I said this because in order for them to <br>
 <br>
 live a healthy lifestyle, they need to eat enough food. Without enough food,<br>
 <br>
 they are having problems. In fact, the lockdown's negative effects on them <br>
 <br>
 resulted in the lost of many members. Above all, this is what they need <br>
 <br>
 the institution's help with in order to improve the beneficiaries' quality of life.</font><br>
